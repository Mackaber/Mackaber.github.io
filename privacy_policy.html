    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: August 24, 2024</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information collected and used by any virtual assistant developed by the creator. Your privacy is important, and this document explains how information is handled when you interact with any of these assistants.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information Collection</h2>
    <p>
        These virtual assistants do not collect personal data unless explicitly provided by the user. The information gathered during interactions is limited to the details you share during your session. This may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Text input (e.g., requests, commands).</li>
        <li>Any files or URLs provided by the user for specific tasks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Use of Information</h2>
    <p>
        The information provided by users is utilized solely to perform the tasks requested. The assistants use this data to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Execute the tasks or provide the services requested by the user.</li>
        <li>Offer recommendations or additional resources based on user queries.</li>
        <li>Enhance the user experience during the interaction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
        These virtual assistants do not retain any information after the session ends. Once the conversation is closed, all data associated with that session is deleted and cannot be retrieved.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        These virtual assistants do not share, sell, or distribute any user-provided information to third parties. All interactions are confined to the session between the user and the assistant.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>
        These virtual assistants are built with security in mind. However, users are encouraged to avoid sharing sensitive or personal information through the assistant. While these assistants do not store data, the nature of online interactions always carries some risk.
    </p>

    <h2>7. User Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
        Users are responsible for the information they choose to share with these virtual assistants. By using any of these assistants, you acknowledge and accept the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in the assistants' functionality or applicable laws. Users will be notified of any significant changes through the platform where the assistant is hosted.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Contact Information</h2>
    <p>
        If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact the developer through the platform where the virtual assistant is deployed.
